| **1. Payroll CRUD API**             | ✅ _AI-reviewed_              | AI assisted in structuring RESTful routes, controller patterns, and validation logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting payroll records. |
| **2. Gross-to-Net Pay Calculation** | ✅ _AI co-authored_           | AI helped design salary deduction formulas and suggested edge cases for testing (e.g., negative salary, 0% bonus, max tax limit).                   |
| **3. Payroll Anomaly Detection**    | ✅ _AI-assisted_              | AI provided ideas for detecting anomalies such as excessive deductions or unusual salary variations, and suggested data threshold strategies.       |
| **4. Secure Authentication**        | ✅ _AI-reviewed_              | AI guided implementation of JWT authentication, middleware structure, and security improvements (e.g., hashing, token validation).                  |
| **5. Developer Documentation**      | ✅ _AI-generated and curated_ | README structure, setup steps, and documentation formatting were produced and refined using AI.                                                     |
| **6. Test Cases**                   | ✅ _AI-supported_             | AI helped draft Jest integration and unit test templates for login and payroll endpoints.                                                           |
